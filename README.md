<!-- SUMMARY:START -->

_A collection of fun and/or useful things you can do with TypeScript._

<!-- SUMMARY:END -->

Take everything you see here with a grain of salt. This is more or less a dump of code snippets with some tests and docs.
I do not claim that all these functions, types and classes have good and correct naming, well done tests or follow good practices, etc.
If no caveats are mentioned, then that doesn't neccessarly mean there aren't any.

That being said: feel free to be inspired and copy any bit of code you can find in this repository. Credit is appreciated.
You are also welcome to make a PR for new additions and improvements.
Make sure to checkout [the list below](#notable-libraries-and-links) for actually battle-tested libraries and helpful links.

Create new collections based on other collections or reduce them to a certain value.
